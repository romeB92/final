        <h2> Who is ROME?</h2>
       <p class ="about">I am an avid gamer, creator and developer. Coding is a passion of mine and creating new content is too. This all started when I was a teenager...I remember playing Mario 64 and was obsessed with the graphics, the storyline and the overall adventure that the game provided.  At that time, I knew I wanted to be a developer and make people feel the way I felt when I played Mario 64.  Inspired, happy, joyful and optimistic. Coding is something that came naturally to me.  Learning it has been a blast and I can't wait to share my creations with all of you!  </p>
